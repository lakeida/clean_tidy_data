# Getting and Cleaning Data

# Overview
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## How to Use this Script
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Set your R session's working directory to the cloned directory (e.g., by using setwd).
3. Execute the run_analysis.R script:

4. source('run_analysis.R')
5. The script will download the data from the project site listed above.

When complete, a file named tidy_data.txt will be created in the working directory.

# Output Data
